CAROUSEL BEHAVIOUR:

- The carousel should automatically cycle through images every 5 seconds.
- Users should be able to pause the automatic cycling by hovering over the carousel.
- Users should be able to manually navigate through the images using next and previous buttons.
- It should contain arrows on each side to advance the image forward or backward. 
-  It should contain the little navigation circles at the bottom that indicate which slide you are on (and they should be clickable to advance to that particular slide).
- The carousel should display a set of images that can be defined in the JavaScript file.
- The carousel should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.
